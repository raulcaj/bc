Hi!

I tried to do this challenge within 2 hours of coding.
I used a lot of functional style programming, I really like to develop with that. :D

The project is a eclipse mars.2/java 8 project.
There are only four classes.
	- Program
		Contains the main method and controls program flow.
	- LinkedInProfile
		An entity
	- LinkedInProfileParser
		Parsers strings to the LinkedInProfile entity
	- ProfileRanker
		Does the ranking

Things to improve..
	- create some junit..
	- remove hardcoded constants..
	- implement more rules for weighting the profiles
	- improve the way the ranking is called
